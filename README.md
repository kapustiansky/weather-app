IT'S DEMO !!!</br>
Technology: React, Redux, Material-UI, used OpenWeather API.</br>

What is done:
1. Brief information about the weather in the city.
2. Ability to add / remove cities. When adding
new city, a request is made to receive the current weather and display
it on the screen.
3. The data is stored locally in LocalStorage (on page reload, the list of previously
entered cities, the weather data is updated).

On development stage:
1. When you click on "Learn More" button - display detailed information / go to
page with detailed information.
2. On the detail page, the button: refresh
weather data now. When pressed, update the weather data of the city.
3. Adding a new query for the hourly forecast for the current day.
